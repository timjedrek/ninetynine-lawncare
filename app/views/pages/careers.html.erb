            One of the main advantages of becoming a 99 Lawn Care owner operator is that it generally has relatively low startup costs compared to other types of businesses. This can make it an attractive option for entrepreneurs who are looking to start a business. Starting a lawn care business starts with purchasing equipment, such as lawn mowers, edgers, and leaf blowers. These costs can typically be kept relatively low if you are careful about what you invest in. 99 Lawn Care will help you find good deals on equipment.  We've been in the industry for a decade and we know which equipment has the best ROI.

            Lawn care is a service that is always in demand. People are always looking for ways to maintain their lawns and keep them looking attractive. But many people are busy with work and other commitments and may not have the time to take care of their own lawns. This creates an opportunity for lawn care businesses to provide a valuable service.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg py-5">
            Most people do not have the time, knowledge, or desire to take care of their own lawns and are willing to pay for someone else to do it for them.  While work generally peaks in the spring and summer months, there are many lawn care tasks that need to be performed year round.   For example, leaves need to be raked and removed in the fall and  many homeowners and businesses have landscaping features such as shrubs, trees, and flowerbeds that need to be maintained year round.  There is high demand for lawn care service.
